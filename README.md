# Tor Client
## No more supported

This app is no more supported. We plan to propose a new alternative for supporting a Tor Client on a Cube, but with more security and goals closer to the Tor project.

## Overview

Tor Client app for [YunoHost](http://yunohost.org/).

Install a Tor tunnel, for broadcasting it through a wifi hotspot.

This YunoHost app is a part of the "[La Brique Internet](http://labriqueinter.net)" project but can be used independently.

## Prerequisites

* Debian Jessie
* YunoHost >= 2.2.0
* [Hotspot app for YunoHost](https://github.com/labriqueinternet/hotspot_ynh)

**[BUG REPORTS SHOULD BE OPEN HERE](https://dev.yunohost.org)**
